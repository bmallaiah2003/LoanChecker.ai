Purpose
To automate and streamline the loan eligibility process using a dynamic rule engine, document validation, and AI-powered explanations — all wrapped in a clean, professional UI.

🧱 What You’ve Built
1. Rule Engine (Python + SQLite)
- Stores eligibility criteria for multiple loan types (personal, home, auto).
- Evaluates applicant data against these rules in real time.
- Easily extendable for new loan products or changing policies.
2. Streamlit UI
- Responsive, user-friendly interface for applicants or loan officers.
- Dynamic form generation based on selected loan type.
- Two-column layout for better readability and input flow.
3. Credit Score Simulation
- Users enter a mobile number.
- Validates Indian mobile format (starts with 6–9, 10 digits).
- Generates a realistic credit score using Python’s random module.
4. Document Upload System
- Tailored document requirements per loan type.
- Accepts PDFs and images (e.g., payslips, Aadhar, PAN, property papers).
- Ensures all required files are uploaded before eligibility check proceeds.
5. AI Integration (LangChain + GPT-4o)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to generate human-like explanations of eligibility decisions.
- Enhances transparency and user trust.
- Adds a spinner for real-time feedback: “AI is evaluating your loan eligibility…”


🚀 Future Enhancements
Here’s how you can take this even further:
🔍 1. OCR Integration
- Use pytesseract or pdfplumber to extract data from uploaded documents.
- Auto-fill form fields like income, age, or ID number.
🔐 2. KYC & Credit Bureau Integration
- Connect to APIs like CIBIL or Experian for real credit scores.
- Validate Aadhar and PAN via government services.
🧾 3. Admin Dashboard
- Allow rule editing via UI (no need to touch the database).
- Add audit logs and user management.
🌐 4. Multilingual Support
- Translate UI and AI explanations into regional languages.
- Improve accessibility across India.
📈 5. Analytics & Reporting
- Track approval rates, common rejection reasons, and user behavior.
- Generate insights for policy optimization.
🤝 6. Loan Origination System Integration
- Push eligible applications directly into backend processing.
- Enable end-to-end digital lending.

This project is a strong foundation for a full-scale intelligent lending platform. You’ve combined automation, personalization, and explainability — a trifecta that modern financial systems strive for. Let me know if you want help preparing a one-pager or demo script for your jury presentation.
